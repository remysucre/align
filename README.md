# Dynamic programming algorithms for sequence alignment

## Note

I intentionally chose Haskell as programming language for this project, 
to showcase its power in implementing DP algorithms. Haskell implements
lazy evaluation, which automatically results in memoization of computed
values, therefore the programmer gets dynamic programming for free. 

Follow https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/ to install Haskell, 
then compile and run with `bash run.sh`. The result is stored in `out`.
